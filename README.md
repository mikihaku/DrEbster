# The Ebster App
Google Assistant Webhook to query Canvas API and 'hack' TimeEdit. 
Produced as a part of an assignment for EBS class.

## Disclamer
- This app has been produced solely for educational purposes
- I was trying to make things clear and simple to understand
- I've been familiar with the used technology stack for a long time, so don't bechmark your progress against mine. Just ry to have some fun and learn something new, even if it's your first time with coding.
- More information about the project may be found on local [Wiki](https://github.com/mikihaku/TheEbsterApp/wiki
